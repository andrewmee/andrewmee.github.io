                Hello, I'm Andrew and I am a front-end web developer with 13 years experience.
                What does that mean? Well put simply, it means I have a great passion for building beautiful, efficient and elegant websites. Websites that draw you in and engage you; websites that do nifty things!

                    <p>[Andrew] single-handedly wrote the front-end code for Songkick 2.0--a daunting task which he handled with calm efficiency! He works quickly and effectively and has a keen eye for both user experience and visual design. I really enjoyed collaborating with Andrew as we talked through design issue</p>
