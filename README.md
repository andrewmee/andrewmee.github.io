My personal website is a space for me to introduce myself to the world.  It's also 
a bit of a sandbox for me to play around with different things that no right-thinking 
person would ever consider for a REAL website.

Feel free to poke around but please excuse any mess - I'm very much designing this as
I go along, so not all of it will make complete sense all the time.
